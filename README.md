# Planning
My planning started from creating wireframes and users stories. Thinking of what tables im going to have in my database and how they are going to be connected with foreign key.

# Development Process
For a developing process I started from creating a HTML file, that had <code>nav bar</code> with buttons for users actions and continued with users api requests. My db was created on a back-end repo so I was able to interact with it. After my users api were tested I continued with HTML and SCSS files. Adding <code>.hide</code> and <code>.show</code> so I could control what user sees with each moment. Then I worked on handlebars and buttons to <code>delete</code> and <code>update</code> notes. At the end I've added an option of automstic sign in with sign up. Features like console.log and debugger helped alot with troubleshooting issues.

# Unsolved Issues
Still need to work on smoother auto sign in and styling for web page. Option of leaving comments on notes are in working progress.
